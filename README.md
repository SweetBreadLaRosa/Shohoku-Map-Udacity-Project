# Shohoku-Map-Udacity-Project


 This is the Neighborhood Map Project for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree

### NOTE:

I've been playing basketball all my life and used that as a them around the city
for the project.

The locations labeled in the app are some gyms that I know of that I play at with some of
of my friends. There are so many improvements I want to make in the future. This
project was awesome to work on!

I also want to note that the third party API used was foursquare.

* This app is mobile friendly, give it a try!
* Shout outs to foursquare for helping me out with this.
